# Context
- What is Yummly? (Screenshot)

# Question
- Given just the ingredients, can we predict which cuisine

# Data
- Screenshot of JSON file
- 30000 training rows
- How many test rows

# Exploratory
- Most Common Cuisine/Most Common Ingredient
  - Unbalanced Classes

# Design Choices
- Whether to tokenize by word?
- Whether to balance classes?
- How to DTM?
  - Five Minimum Documents?
  - TF IDF? 

# One Shot Models (Do these models miss the same things?)
- Naive Bayes: 78% Accuracy
- Unregularized Logistic Regression: 78% Accuracy
- Regularized Logistic Regression?
- Support Vector Machine?
- Random Forest?
- XGBoost? 

# Pipeline Models
- DecisionTree/RandomForest--> Cooperative Ensemble
- PCA/LDA-->Logistic Regression
- RandomForestEmbedding --> Regularized Logistic Regression
